## Usage

1. Export your Apple Music cookies in **Netscape format**
   - Firefox: [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/get-cookies-txt-locally)
   - Chrome/Edge: [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc?utm_source=item-share-cb)
2. Launch AMDL, click "Browse" to select `cookies.txt`, click "Check" to verify

> **Requires a valid Apple Music subscription. For personal use only. Respect copyright.**

### Important Notes

- **Region Restrictions**: Ensure the song is available in your Apple Music account's region. For example, a US account cannot download songs exclusive to the China store. If you see "Resource Not Found (404)", check whether the track is playable in your account region.
- **Launcher**: Always use `启动.bat` to launch. Running `AMDL.exe` directly may cause encoding issues on non-English Windows.
- **Cookies Expiry**: Re-export your cookies file if it expires.
